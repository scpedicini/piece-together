# How do I request a new puzzle?

Before submitting a puzzle, it's a good idea to field test it in the actual app itself by using "Add Custom Puzzle" - the puzzle/video will stay entirely on your hardware and is not submitted to our servers. If you feel like people might enjoy playing it, then you can continue to a public submission. This involves opening a regular Github issue with the following information:

- A public facing URL to the animation (preferably an MP4)
- A link to the original artist (they will be credited with a link in the puzzle itself)

For obvious reasons, I will only accept original submissions or artwork which is in the public domain.
