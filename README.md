# Overview
Github repository for managing requesting and adding new guest puzzles to the [Piece Together Animated Puzzle Game](https://animated-puzzles.specr.net)

# How do I request a new puzzle?

Submit a regular Github Issue with the following information

- A public facing URL to the animation (preferably an MP4)
- A link to the original artist (they will be credited with a link in the puzzle itself)

For obvious reasons, I will only accept original submissions or artwork which is in the public domain.
